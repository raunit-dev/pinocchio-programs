## Repository Structure

```

â””â”€â”€ basics/
    â”œâ”€â”€ address-onchain/

Each folder in `basics/` contains a self-contained program, generally written in Rust for the Solana blockchain. These are designed as practical, hands-on examples for learning and experimentation.

## Programs in `basics/`

### address-onchain

A simple example for exploring how to derive and use addresses on the Solana blockchain. This program likely demonstrates:
- Creating and working with public keys and on-chain addresses.
- Understanding Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
- Basic Solana account management.

### close-account

Shows how to safely close Solana accounts and reclaim lamports (Solanaâ€™s native tokens) to a specified recipient wallet. This program typically covers:
- The process of closing accounts programmatically.
- Safe transfer of remaining balances.
- Best practices to avoid account rent and unnecessary storage.

### counter-program

A classic Solana example implementing a persistent on-chain counter. This program demonstrates:
- State management in Solana smart contracts.
- Reading and updating account data.
- Transaction processing and instruction handling.

### hello-world-solana

The canonical "Hello, World!" for Solana smart contracts. This is a great starting point for:
- Understanding the minimum structure of a Solana program.
- Deploying and invoking basic instructions.
- Logging and debugging output from on-chain programs.

### store-your-favs

A sample application for storing and retrieving user preferences or favorite items on-chain. This example helps you learn:
- How to serialize and deserialize data in Solana accounts.
- Managing user input and storing custom data structures.
- Accessing and updating multiple user accounts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (with the `solana` toolchain): [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Solana CLI tools**: [Install Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- **Git**: To clone the repository

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raunit-dev/pinocchio-programs.git
cd pinocchio-programs/basics
```

---

## How to Run the Examples

Each program in `basics/` is generally a standalone Solana program. To build and deploy one, navigate to its directory and use Cargo:

```bash
cd basics/counter-program
cargo build-bpf  # or 'cargo build-sbf' for Solana's Sealevel backend

# Deploy to localnet:
solana-test-validator    # In a new terminal, start the validator
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/counter_program.so
```

> **Note:** Follow the specific README or comments inside each program directory for more detailed instructions, as some examples may require additional setup or client scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new examples, fix bugs, or suggest improvements:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your changes.
3. **Commit** your updates with clear messages.
4. **Push** to your fork and open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your example includes clear comments and, if possible, a brief README or usage note inside the programâ€™s directory.
